# Data Science - Portfolio

This repository's goal is to apply some data science stastistical concepts acquired by this repository's author.
There are classification, regression, clustering, temporal analysis problems, and so on.

Inside each folder contains its README file, data source reference, solution, conclusions, methodologies used description, some links (ex.: GAN) just contains the reference to the solution video in my Linkedin profile, and so on.

**Note: This repository is under continuous updating in order to correct bugs, correct conceptual errors and typo, implement improvements, and solve new problems.**
