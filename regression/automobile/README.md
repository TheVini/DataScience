# Automobile Dataset

Exercise-based on a dataset published on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/toramky/automobile-dataset

**Goal:** Finding a model which can  accurately predict car price based on some features.

**Propouse:**

- Accomplishing an exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
- Identifying and dealing with possible skewed data, where applicable.
- Accomplishing hypothesis tests by analyzing data variation, where applicable.
- Accomplishing normality tests.
- Identifying possible correlations.
- Solving possible overfitting and underfitting problems, if necessary.
- Accomplishing data normalization and coeficient regularization techniques, if necessary.
- Finding which algorithm have the best performance: Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, Lasso, GradientBoostingRegressor, Ridge, KNeighborsRegressor, PLSRegression, ElasticNet, XGBRegressor, XGBRFRegressor and RandomForestRegressor
- Applying K-Fold cross-validation.
- Validating results with confusion matrix
- Checking algorithms' results variability.
