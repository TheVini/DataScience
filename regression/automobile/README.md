## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

<details><summary>Show Dataset columns' analysis</summary>
<ul>
<li> There is nullable columns, BUT there is another character doing the same thing, the "?", as shown in the Kaggle dataset discription, as well as many columns are described as "object" type just because this "?" represanting the nullable values, but this columns are or int64 either float64, this is not real for all "object" type columns but it is reall including for the response variable column. It proves:
<ol>
 <li> There is null data, so there is the need to delete elements/columns or to add data by interpolation, mean, or mode.
 <li> There is the need to cast some columns.
</ol>
<li> Between explicative variables, there are some qualitative variables ("object" type), quantiative ones - discrete (most of them of "int64" type) and continuous (most of them of "float64").
<li> Afterwards, it was noticed it is necessary to apply data normalization technique to some columns.

### 3.2. Oversampling and Undersampling Technique - With skewed data, no attribute selection, normalized data with Standard Scaler, dataset size for test 30%

**Analysis:** on exploratory data analysis, it was seen that classes of some important explicative variables ("drive-wheels" - 58%, "engine-location" - 33%, "num-of-cylinders" - 65%, "fuel-system" - 52%) are unbalanced between their classes. So, Oversampling and Undersampling technique were choosen to solve this problem and a satisfactory result was achieved applying them just on the "num-of-cylinders" variable. The Oversampling (RandomOverSampler) and Undersampling (RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours) techniques choosen in this project are the same used in the "Credit Card" classfication project which is in this same Github repository, and on that ocasion they showed a satisfactory performance improvement for the algorithms.

## 4. Conclusion

Even with no data transformation for skewed data, a good result was achieved with both algorithms during tests after applying oversampling and undersampling techniques, under 30 training loops. Such techniques improved algorithms performance by average of 14.4% (standard deviation - 4,947) over the same algorithms with no oversampling and undersampling techniques. The DecisionTreeRegressor was improved in 21.768%. After K-Fold cross-validation, section 3.3, Almost all algorithms hept their performance with a low variance - less than 2%. The best algorithms R2 Score during K-Fold cross-validation were: GradientBoostingRegressor(99.577%), DecisionTreeRegressor(99.567%), RandomForestRegressor(99.551%), XGBRegressor(99.386%), and XGBRFRegressor(99.262%).
