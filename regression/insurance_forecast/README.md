# Medical Cost Personal Datasets

Exercise-based on a dataset published on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

**Goal:** Finding a model which can accurately predict insurance costs.

**Propouse:**

- Accomplishing an exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
- Identifying and dealing with possible skewed data, where applicable.
- Accomplishing hypothesis tests by analyzing data variation, where applicable.
- Accomplishing normality tests.
- Identifying possible correlations.
- Solving possible overfitting and underfitting problems, if necessary.
- Accomplishing data normalization and coeficient regularization techniques, if necessary.
- Finding which algorithm have the best performance: Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, Lasso, GradientBoostingRegressor, Ridge, KNeighborsRegressor, PLSRegression, ElasticNet, XGBRegressor, XGBRFRegressor and RandomForestRegressor
- Applying K-Fold cross-validation.
- Validating results with confusion matrix
- Checking algorithms' results variability.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

<details><summary>Show Dataset columns' analysis</summary>
<ul>
<li> By getting "non-null" results below, it proves that there is no null data, so there is no need to delete elements/columns or to add data by interpolation.
<li> Between explicative variables, there are some qualitative variables ("object" type), quantiative ones - discrete (most of them of "int64" type) and continuous (most of them of "float64").
<li> Afterwards, it was noticed it is necessary to apply data normalization technique to some columns.
</ul>

<details><summary>Show columns' distributions and box plots analysis</summary>
 <ul>
<li> There are skewed data in some columns and it can be seen on quantitative explicative variables' histograms and on their boxplots.

<details><summary>Show pairwaise correlation analysis</summary>
 <ul>
<li> The heatmap for Pearson correlation table below proves no explicative variable is, at least, on moderate level, according to Evans classification, Evans (1996, also http://leg.ufpr.br/~silvia/CE003/node74.html, on Brazilian portuguese)
