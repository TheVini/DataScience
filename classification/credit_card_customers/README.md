# Credit Card customers

Exercise-based on a dataset published in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers

**Goal:** Finding a model which can predict which credit card clients are gonna get churned.

**Propouse:**

 - Accomplishing an exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
 - Identifying and dealing with possible skewed data, where applicable.
 - Accomplishing hypothesis tests by analyzing data variation, where applicable.
 - Accomplishing normality tests.
 - Identifying possible correlations.
 - Accomplishing oversampling or undersampling techniques to solve possible imbalance problem, if necessary.
 - Solving possible overfitting and underfitting problems, if necessary.
 - Accomplishing data normalization and coeficient regularization techniques, if necessary.
 - Accomplishing attribute selection, if necessary.
 - Finding which algorithm have the best performance: Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Tree Decision, Random Forest, and SVC
 - Applying K-Fold cross-validation.
 - Validating results with confusion matrix
 - Checking algorithms' results variability.
