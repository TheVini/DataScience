## Swiss banknote conterfeit detection

Exercise-based on a dataset published in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/chrizzles/swiss-banknote-conterfeit-detection

**Goal:** Finding a model which can identify genuine and conterfeit banknotes.

**Propouse:**

 - Accomplishing an exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
 - Identifying and dealing with possible skewed data, where applicable.
 - Accomplishing hypothesis tests by analyzing data variation, where applicable.
 - Accomplishing normality tests.
 - Identifying possible correlations.
 - Accomplishing oversampling or undersampling techniques to solve possible imbalance problem, if necessary.
 - Solving possible overfitting and underfitting problems, if necessary.
 - Accomplishing data normalization and coeficient regularization techniques, if necessary.
 - Accomplishing attribute selection, if necessary.
 - Finding which algorithm have the best performance: Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Tree Decision, Random Forest, and SVC
 - Applying K-Fold cross-validation.
 - Validating results with confusion matrix
 - Checking algorithms' results variability.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

<details><summary>Show Dataset columns' analysis</summary>
<ul>
<li> By getting "non-null" results below, it proves that there is no null data, so there is no need to delete elements/columns or to add data by interpolation.
<li> The data below proves that some normalization technique is needed on explicative variables and they are also continuous.
</ul>

<details><summary>Show 'conterfeit' classes distribution</summary>
<ul>
<li> The response variable, 'conterfeit', is perfect balanced between its classes. So there is no need of using undersampling or oversampling techniques.
</ul>

<details><summary>Show explicative columns' distributions analysis</summary>
<ul>
<li> The distribution graphics below also proves that data normalization is need to some explicative variables, as well as, it shows some different kind of distributions: bimodal, normal, left and tight skewed.

<details><summary>Show pairwaise correlation analysis</summary>
<p>From the heatmap of Pearson correlation described below, it can be extracted some conclusios when compare all variables to "conterfeit". According to Evans (1996 - "Evans JD (1996) Straight forward statistics for the behavioral sciences. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co, Pacific Grove", also http://leg.ufpr.br/~silvia/CE003/node74.html - in portuguese) classification for Pearson correlation, follow below the conclusions about the correlation between all variables and variable "conterfeit":</p>
<ul>
<li> Very strong: Diagonal
<li> Strong: Bottom
<li> Moderate: Left, Right, Top
<li> Very weak: Lenght
</ul>

<details><summary>Show Scatter and Distribution plots analysis</summary>
<ul>
<li> In addition, the Scatter and Distributions plot below show that variable "Diagonal" strongly explain the variable "conterfeit".
