Exercise-based on a dataset published on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/chrizzles/swiss-banknote-conterfeit-detection

Goal: Finding a model which can identify genuine and conterfeit banknotes.

Propouse:

    Accomplishing an exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
    Identifying and dealing with possible skewed data, where applicable.
    Accomplishing hypothesis tests by analyzing data variation, where applicable.
    Accomplishing normality tests.
    Identifying possible correlations.
    Accomplishing oversampling or undersampling techniques to solve possible imbalance problem, if necessary.
    Solving possible overfitting and underfitting problems, if necessary.
    Accomplishing data normalization and coeficient regularization techniques, if necessary.
    Accomplishing attribute selection, if necessary.
    Finding which algorithm have the best performance: Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Tree Decision, Random Forest, and SVC
    Applying K-Fold cross-validation.
    Validating results with confusion matrix
    Checking algorithms' results variability.
