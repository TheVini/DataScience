### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

<details><summary>Show Dataset columns' analysis</summary>
<ul>
<li> By getting "non-null" results below, it proves that there is no null data, so there is no need to delete elements/columns or to add data by interpolation.
<li> The data below proves that some normalization technique is needed on explicative variables and they are also continuous.
</ul>

<details><summary>Show 'conterfeit' classes distribution</summary>
<ul>
<li> The response variable, 'conterfeit', is perfect balanced between its classes. So there is no need of using undersampling or oversampling techniques.

<details><summary>Show pairwaise correlation analysis</summary>
<p>From the heatmap of Pearson correlation described below, it can be extracted some conclusios when compare all variables to "conterfeit". According to Evans (1996 - "Evans JD (1996) Straight forward statistics for the behavioral sciences. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co, Pacific Grove", also http://leg.ufpr.br/~silvia/CE003/node74.html - in portuguese) classification for Pearson correlation, follow below the conclusions about the correlation between all variables and variable "conterfeit":</p>
<ul>
<li> Very strong: Diagonal
<li> Strong: Bottom
<li> Moderate: Left, Right, Top
<li> Very weak: Lenght
</ul>

### 5. Conclusion

Even with no data transformation for skewed data, a good result was achieved with both algorithms during tests, section 3, using 30 train loops. But, during K-Fold cross-validation, section 4, just SVC algorithm achieved a real different result from section 3. On the 4 one, SVC reached a lower result. Other algorithms reached a good result on cross-validation, a special consideration for Logistic Regression which reached the higher result.
